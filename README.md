### DISCLAIMER


This project involves implementing a Python-based framework for Multi-Agent Deep-Q Learning, focusing on coordinated transport in a small grid world with heterogeneous agents. The agents, classified as Type 1 and Type 2, must collaborate through handovers to successfully accomplish the transport task. The deep reinforcement learning methodology is applied to train the agents in finding optimal paths, and the project delves into a thorough analysis of their behavior using game theory principles.

The PDF encapsulating the core ideas of the game theoretic analysis. It also included some elements of describing the game theory model and documented its simplifications, as these are necessary to understand the functioning of the Game Theory model.
